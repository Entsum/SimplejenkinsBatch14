CI/CD :
    Continues integration and continue development
    all the software that use whether its a website or app or any operating system
    They are in a continue state change. We need to continuously develop and update
    these software so that customers can use the latest features.
    Jenkins is one such software that will help us automate this process.

1) Once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine,
   developer pushes that code to the development server.
